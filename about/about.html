			<h3>History of Walk-to-Live</h3>
			<p class="historytext1">The Walk-to-Live Walkathon was created as a way for communities of color to take preventive action against childhood obesity in highly affected areas of New York City.

		<h3>History of Imani House</h3>
		<p class="historytext2">Imani House is a Brooklyn-based nonprofit founded in 1991, known for its free, innovative youth and family support services. It’s goal is to assist marginalized youth, families, and immigrants to create vibrant neighborhoods where residents are decision makers who take responsibility for the improvement of their lives and surroundings.<br></br> 

		Imani House seeks to address a range of community needs, including community health.  At the height of childhood obesity rates in New York City, the organization implemented programs to help alleviate the problem. Children registered in Imani House’s programs participate in martial arts, dance, and fencing at no cost to their families, all of which encourage healthy lifestyles.  Additionally, Imani House is proactive in promoting nutritious eating. Through our programs, children have access to nutrition education classes to learn the importance of maintaining a healthy diet.<br></br>

		Imani House also runs a health clinic in Liberia that provides much needed pre- and post-natal care to pregnant women in and around Monrovia. Imani House’s dedication to improving health outcomes for the communities we serve. You can learn more about our work in Liberia here.</p>
