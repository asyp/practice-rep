			<p class="obesity">In America, nearly one in three children are overweight or obese. Studies suggest that one third of all children born in 2000 or later will suffer from diabetes at some point in their lives. Many others will face chronic obesity-related health problems like heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer, and asthma.</p>

			<p class ="walking">Imani House believes living healthy lives begins with the formation of healthy habits during childhood. Walk-to-Live is a day to bring awareness to this problem and involve all those who are important influences in young peopleâ€™s lives.</p>

			<p class="fun">Imani House views the prevention and reduction of childhood obesity as a community effort that involves parents, families and schools. Walk-to-Live is a day in which everyone comes together to raise awareness and have FUN!</p>
